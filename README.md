### Docker

#### Running the compose services

The project has been divided into separate docker services, the frontend (react-ui), express api (express-api) and postgreSQL database (postgres).  
Populate all .env files, based on the keys in the .env.default files.  
All of these can be started with the command: `docker compose up`  

#### Accessing the postgreSQL database  

If only wanting to start the database you can run the command: `docker compose up postgres` (note that this is not dependent upon the other services and so is able to run alone.)  

- Open bash session within the postgres container: `docker exec -it postgres /bin/bash`  
- Login to the local db with default credentials: `psql -U postgres`  
- View existing databases: `\l`
- View existing tables in current database: `\dt`
- Describe a table: `\d <tablename>` e.g. `\d users`
